"The problem with sexual intercourse is that a lot of the time there are jokes about women not being pleasured enough, that males finish before females are completely pleased.There is a point to this joking, not that this should be the standard but that this should be a painful reminder that it might take longer for females to be ready for sex. Females need more than stimulation, they need preparation.The vagina needs to be ready for penetration, that takes patience. You can't just ram in a penis and expect a woman just be ready for an orgasm deep in the vagina. You have to stimulate the mind, stimulate the emotions, stimulate the skin, stimulate the neck, and then stimulate the other areas of the body before you even get to lay a hand on a female erogenous zone like the breasts or mons, let alone move your fingers inside the labia. You need patience to even read through that sentence before you can even touch a female anywhere near the vagina, outside of having the maturity to know in the first place. You do not ram a penis inside a vagina period. It takes a lot of stretching out of the vagina and warming up with a lot of intercourse to actually get to the A-spot but as with the other spots it takes time, and a lot of work to get to an orgasm in the first place.  The mechanism of sex is easy to do, otherwise there wouldn't be so many unplanned births, but orgasms are another matter. It takes patience, sensitivity, a light touch in certain areas, and sometimes if you take enough time to stimulate enough you can ejaculate from stimulation, it feels like pee because it accumulates in the bladder but its actually a different mixture than pee and has a different smell (cleaner, fresher) and texture than pee, and feels different from the lubricant that accumulates from the vaginal area. Just remember that it might not be the right time of your cycle to have sex. A vagina has more elasticity during different parts of the month and no matter what you do you cannot get the right blend to be comfortable during sex. That is alright. I also am not mentioning what time of your cycle would be the best or worst time to have sex because that depends on the female.  You also need to know where your body parts are before you can ask for your partner to touch you. This is called familiarizing yourself with what works for you and what does and this can happen with or without a partner present. A diagram will not tell you what is going on inside you or how your body parts work, for example, personally my uterus is on the other side of my vagina from the diagram, the uterus points toward my spine rather than my stomach, so some times the wrong angle during sex will hurt and not in a good way. Surprisingly a largish percentage of females live with this condition, I only found out when I had a pap smear.  We are taught so squeamishly about the reproduction system and combined that with sexual education that so many get embarrassed when talking about both. Many are taught misinformation, like that a female has a vagina, or a women can control the flow of her menstrual blood (yes, that was a US Legislator in Congress), if they are even taught that much, which typically turns out to mean any part of the general female genitalia area between their legs. A vagina is the tube that is in between a female uterus and the perineum. There are other items in between a females legs that have names.  I really didn't expect to write so much about what I've learned over the years. I wasn't in an environment to learn about my body growing up, it took decades for me to even be in a place to actually want to learn about sex. I learned so much since I've started looking about sexual organs, sexuality, gender, and the sex acts themselves. I could probably talk more about this, but right now on this reply, I'm going to cut myself off because I'm tired. But there is more knowledge out there, you just have to look. I pointed out a couple places, but you can look into sexologists \[see sexplanations channel on youtube with Dr. Lindsey Doe\], there are ladies out there who have their PhDs their degrees on the female body and sexual knowledge in general.

"Hey OP, I can't speak for your ex, but as someone who went through something similar (sort of) I'd like to offer some insight.   I lost my father this last Christmas (on the day, actually) and he and I were very, very close. Growing up I always had abandonment issues because my parents didn't have a stable relationship either. I was mostly raised by my mom, but not because of my dads choice. We visited him every chance we got and had a great relationship.   When he passed away it was the hardest loss I've ever experienced. It still is. I still cry most days. My partner has been wonderful from the very beginning.   For probably a month I wasn't able to be sexually intimate. He was patient and never pushed. I believe I initiated sexual intimacy a little too soon for myself but I didn't want my relationship to become strained and I didn't want my partner to feel like he was being punished. (Not that he would have felt that way.)   That being said, our frequency has gone from 6 days a week to maybe 1-3. With that amount I feel a deep insecurity of fearing that he may want to stray. He wouldn't, and isn't, but I know how important sexual intimacy is to maintain the health of the relationship so I am even more insecure that he would leave.   &amp;#x200B;  Reading your experience, I think that she was insecure and afraid that she would lose you too.

"No apologies needed, man - I apologise if I came across a bit strong.  Now, I'm in the UK, so can only speak from that perspective. It's only really in the past few years that we've really begun to talk about the management of chronic pain with anything other than escalating doses of increasingly potent drugs - mainly opioids, but also neuropathics like gabapentin and pregabalin. From a base level it makes sense, right? You're in pain, so you need higher doses. Most doctors really don't like watching people suffer, and opioids work - or at least they seem to, short term.  Turns out there's more to it than that, and there's a whole lot more research into the issue coming out of the woodwork. Increasingly it appears that yes, opioids do work for acute pain, and they work moderately well (although simple analgesia like paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen are often really effective, too - but that's another story). However, they are rapidly addictive, and the body develops a tolerance to them equally quickly. Not only that, but if a pain becomes ""chronic"" (meaning longer-lasting, for anyone who doesn't know that), then this analgesic effect starts to show some disadvantages.  The greatest of these is the addiction, no doubt, plus a whole raft of side effects like drowsiness, constipation, nausea, even memory loss. However, there is also a very unpleasant effect of being on long-term analgesia called ""hyperalgesia"". This essentially means that any signals getting through to the brain are interpreted as pain, rather than as normal sensory input. This tends to make the nature of chronic pain more severe, more enduring, and more unpleasant than the initial injury would suggest. Chronic pain also tends to affect mood - we don't like being in pain, and suffering for prolonged periods of time tends to make us unhappy. Guess what that does? It makes us more sensitive to pain, and worse affected by any pain we do feel. The whole thing tends to combine to form a horrible cycle of hyperalgesia, low mood, and worsening chronic pain, despite escalating doses of potent painkillers.  The problem that we're now facing is what to do about it? There are tens of thousands of people chugging along, barely functioning, on elephant-tranquilising doses of these drugs. Obviously the solution, from a medical stand-point, is to reduce the doses for these people, but that's likely to create an initial flare of pain as the analgesic effects wear off. It also creates a lot of mistrust and worry - ""I was told that these drugs would help my pain, but now you're telling me I'd addicted to them and I can't have them"". It's understandable - I think I'd be in the same boat if it were me. It doesn't help that the pharmaceutical industry hasn't exactly showed itself to be anything other than fairly predatory when it comes to prescribing, and that doctors of yesteryear were heavily incentivised to prescribe by Big Pharma - something that, at least in the UK, is incredibly heavily regulated now (drug reps can't even give you a free pen, let alone take you on holiday if you agree to prescribe their brand of oxycodone).  Nobody really knows quite what to do, as we've never found ourselves in this situation before. Some chronic pain patients take matters into their own hands and use things like marijuana or CBD-products, and there's certainly some good evidence for pain relief, and a lot of interesting research going on into cannabinoid receptors and analgesia. However, it's likely to be a long time before anything hits the market, because drug trials are (thankfully) pretty rigorous these days. Some treatments like acupuncture give individuals fantastic relief of their symptoms, but large-scale studies often fail to find any stastically proven benefits. For some people surgery appears to help, and for others it makes matters much worse. Some ideas, like meditation-based approaches to analgesia, and even dedicated ""yoga for back pain"" type approaches, have shown promise in recent years.  In the UK we also have what are called ""pain clinics"", usually run by anaesthetists with a special interest in chronic pain. These aim to reduce opioid doses and rationalise prescribing (i.e bringing people off multiple different drugs to the lowest tolerated dose of just one, to minimise side-effects and interactions), as well as focusing on psychological approaches to pain management, treating the depression and associated psychological issues that being saddled with chronic pain can cause. I'm a GP - so my understanding of these things is relatively limited compared to these guys. If you're looking for a drug recommendation, I'm afraid I'm unlikely to be able to help much; you've almost certainly tried everything that I'd be able to suggest, and it's always a bit dicey making drug recommendations over the Internet to someone you've never met. Ultimately it's a case of working out what works best for you, and many people find a combined approach based on multiple facets of the above is more successful than just medication or just psychological approaches.

"but the gist seems to be that frontiersmen"" it wasn't just the frontiersmen, but every American lol. I attached the whole thing so you can read it. People were having a lot of fun with the language in the US much to British displeasure.    Below this point is the article.   American English is not what it used to be.  Today, even fluent American speakers will have trouble understanding an 1840 editorial judging the national Government ''teetotaciously exflunctified.'' Teetotaciously is, simply, ''totally'' with extra syllables added, a kind of stretch limo of Old American speech. Exflunctified, a longer variant of the slang ''exflunct,'' means ''worn out.''  Only a century ago, an American could well say, ''If you confisticate my antifogmatic, at least bring me some tea barefoot.'' Confisticate, actually an extended version of ''confiscate,'' meant ''to take away.'' Antifogmatic, a synonym for ''rum,'' was believed to work wonders against the dampness of fog; the medical ending ''-matic,'' as in ''rheumatic,'' was added to make this strong drink sound medicinal. A drink with nothing added, such as tea without cream and sugar, was served barefoot, ''pure or uncontaminated.''  Just as the common language of Britain and the United States evolved from Old English, our own heritage of words and phrases deserves the title of Old American. Old American was a spoken rather than a literary language. You won't find its playful terms in the fiction of Nathaniel Hawthorne or in the measured prose of the Declaration of Independence (Thomas Jefferson didn't write in an early draft that ''all men are created teetotaciously equal''). Instead, the record of these disappearing words comes mostly from their use in newspaper stories or frontier tales.  No one knows how many Old American words have come and gone, and linguists can't agree on how many of these tyrannosaurs of our language came into being or why they became extinct. Take the verb explaterate, ''to talk at length,'' which originated in Boston in 1831. Some linguists consider this word to be a blend of ''explain'' and ''elaborate''; others point to an older English verb ''explate'' or ''explait'' (meaning ''to tell'' or ''to express'') and argue that explaterate is an extension of that word. In any case, the shorter ''explain'' has outlasted explaterate, which faded in the 1890's.  Part of the reason for such word inventions was that the new circumstances of a brand-new country, which the United States was during the late 18th century, demanded a new vocabulary. Eager to sever British connections, the founders considered a proposal to make Greek the official American language, until a sensible patriot pointed out that ''it would be more convenient for us to keep the language as it is and make the English speak Greek.''  The earliest reports of an American dialect came from disdainful British visitors, who pronounced it ''barbarous'' or ''debased.'' A British writer, visiting the United States in the early 19th century, overheard an American leader exclaim, in an argument about ways to quadruple or quintuple an investment, ''Sir, if I had done so, I should not only have doubled and trebled, but I should have fourbled and fivebled my money.''  Noah Webster, the premier American dictionary maker, asked Basil Hall, a British naval officer, to explain why American words were unworthy. ''Because,'' Captain Hall replied, with British finality, ''there are words enough already.''  Ironically, many of the new words belittled in Britain as ''Americanisms'' were actually British in origin. (Jefferson was belittled for his 1782 coinage of belittle.) Consider wamblecropped. This adjective began in Britain in the 16th century to describe the onset of a stomachache. ''Wamble'' meant ''to feel nausea,'' and ''cropped'' probably grew out of the verb ''crop'' -''to gather.'' While wamblecropped fell into disuse in Britain, it flourished across the Atlantic as a term for ''ill'' in the North and ''drunk'' in the South.  Whenever older English words seemed inadequate, our forebears stretched and reworked the existing language. Their tall tales of the American frontier seemed to require ''tall talk,'' words that piled syllables upon hyperbole.  ''Inscribe'' became inscribulate. ''Ruinous'' was replaced in the South and West by ruinatious. Destructive storms could be ruinatious, leaving farmers to stare in wonderation (''wonder'' was obviously not sufficiently expressive) at property that was catawamptiously chawed up, or totally destroyed. There is speculation that catawamptiously came from ''catawampus,'' a Southwestern mythical creature, the name probably stemming from ''catamount,'' a wildcat. But no one knows why the word, whimsically lengthened, came to mean ''completely.''  For the pioneers, tall talk provided as big a challenge as sharpshooting, with the frontiersman Davy Crockett boasting, ''I can outspeak any man.'' He is reputedly the source of sanctimoniouslyfied, a jocular term for someone overly pious.  Probably in that playful spirit, trousers went beyond unmentionables to become unwhisperables. There's also dictionatical - ''authorized or approved by the dictionary.'' Harold Wentworth's American Dialect Dictionary recorded a 1914 use in central Kansas of this adjective, which sounds like a natural for Scrabble challenges (''That word isn't dictionatical!'').  Such license with the language shouldn't seem foreign to us. These variations may have resulted from mishearing an unfamiliar word or trying to intensify a word's meaning by extending its length. (Just listen to small children for a while, and you might hear ''interesting'' pronounced as ''in-stressting,'' or television's Emmy Awards targeted as ''Enemy Awards.'') Many Old Americanisms might have come into being, says Joan Hall, the associate editor of the Dictionary of American Regional English, because of a fondness among our forebears for ''faddish pseudo-Latin words that sound highfalutin.''  Tall-talking differed from region to region. Southerners seemed quite taken with suffixes like ''-ment.'' Neighbors who liked to gossip or gabble were known for their gabblement. Deep concern was worryment. Confusion caused by speed became hurryment. Feverish activity was flurryment. From New England came slangwhang, a rhyming compound for any political talk that turns out to be nonsense; ''whang'' could be a synonym for the verb ''toss'' or for the noun ''twang.'' (''No new taxes'' is late-20th-century slangwhang.) The first use of slangwhanger - in 1807, in Washington Irving's satirical periodical Salmagundi - referred to editors as knights who fight with words. According to Mitford M. Mathews's A Dictionary of Americanisms, slangwhanger applies to ''a low, noisy talker or writer.''  Out of the West came blends (what Lewis Carroll later called ''portmanteau words''), melodious mixtures of terms. Behavior that was both savage and dangerous was savagerous. Grandiferous was used to describe a landscape that appeared grand and splendiferous.  The frontier also gave rise to compound words. Clatterwhacking, first used in 1851 to describe a great noise, combined the word for ''commotion'' with another indicating something big, as in ''That is a whacking bargain.'' Wayback, first used by pioneers to refer to someone way back in the woods, became a noun for ''someone behind the times.''  All advocates of Old American are, by definition, linguistic waybacks.",reddit_comment,informal,"This text exhibits numerous informal characteristics, including: casual language ('lol', 'gist'), contractions ('wasn't', 'can't'), first and second person pronouns ('you', 'our'), conversational tone ('People were having a lot of fun'), and informal punctuation (lack of proper capitalization at the beginning, use of 'lol').
